This collection of Storable entities, is also used to document the Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that is stored in the database. (In Finnish: henkilörekisteri).

## Releases

### 0.4.0

- Added `Storable` parent class to all entities, to make it easier to handle them in a generic way.
- Key of a `Storable` is now a non optional `String` instead of `String?`. A key of a new entity will
  be generated by the firebase backend – and should be omitted (or set to '' (empty string)) when 
  creating a new `Storable` entity.

### 0.3.0

Support for entites on Pelilauta 14+.

### 0.2.0

Support for firestore entities used by Pelilauta and Charna.
